# Todo List API

The Todo List API provides a robust platform for managing tasks within a todo list application. It supports various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo list items. The API features authentication and authorization mechanisms powered by JWT tokens to ensure secure access.

In addition to basic CRUD operations, the API incorporates two distinct roles: admin and employee. Admin users have the privilege to assign tasks to employees. Once assigned, employees can update the status of their tasks to reflect progress, marking them as "On progress" while actively working on them and eventually as "Done" upon completion.

Furthermore, the API includes functionality for exporting and importing todo lists using Excel files, enhancing the utility and versatility of task management within the application. Development of this application is ongoing, with continual updates planned for the future.
